# PaWPal

##Overview

<b>Xcode 7 / Swift 2</b>

PaWPal (Productivity and Wellness Pal) is an iOS app that seeks to improve 
users' productivity and mood. Users take short surveys throughout the day about 
their experiences, and from this data, they can reflect on their wellness via 
insightful graphs and charts.

##Develop

Note: PaWPal for iOS is developed using Xcode 7 / Swift 2, which means it is 
<b>unavailable for iOS 10 devices</b>.

To get PaWPal on your own computer, fork and clone this repository. If you are new to git remote or forks, read [FORK.md](FORK.md) for a short guide on how to sync your fork to the main repository.

When developing or testing PaWPal, use Xcode Workspace (not Xcode Project) because PaWPal relies on Cocoapods.

Also, ensure that you are developing on the PaWPal scheme and not Pods.
